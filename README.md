# Introduction
Microcontroller code for Microsoft Hacking STEM What is the electromagnetic spectrum? lesson plan adapted for Arduino

 This spectrometer project uses LEDs as light sensors (photodiode) to detect and measure different wavelengths in various types of light sources.

# Getting Started
1. Download lesson assets at https://aka.ms/hackingSTEM
2. Build the spectrometer!
3. Use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to flash the NasaRadiationArduino.ino to your [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
 microcontroller.
4. Verify data interactions in Excel
5. Go forth and science all the things!
