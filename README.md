# Introduction 
 This spectrometer project uses LEDs as light sensors (photodiode) to detect and measure 
 different wavelengths in various types of light sources. 

# Getting Started
1.	Download lesson assets at https://aka.ms/hackingSTEM
2.	Build the spectrometer!
3.	Use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to flash the
 NasaRadiationArduino.ino to your [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
 microcontroller.
4.	Verify data interactions in Excel
5. Go forth and science all the things!
